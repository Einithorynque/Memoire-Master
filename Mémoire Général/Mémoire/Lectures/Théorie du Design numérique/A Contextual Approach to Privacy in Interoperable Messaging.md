## Introduction

Many communication app at the same time. We do have a lot of social circles, family or work related. We have priority : anti Meta. Telegram need to be set as encrypted.   

How do you design to a all ecosystem and not only for your app / usage. 

Matrix conference, new message protocole. 

Interoperable Messaging : imagine that their is a new super cool app but you have nobody to come in. Now in europe meta is supposed to be interoperable to other application. We should be able to talk with people frome signal to whatsapp. 

Root subject of the conf : The problem that come with interoperability ? 

## Privacy

What is privacy : 
- privacy as territory (my side of the desk)
- privacy as user attitudes, privacy persona
- privacy as a right (to be forgotten, inform etc)
- privacy as secrecy

What if we asked : 
When do people perceive the sharing of data as a privacy violation ? As a starting point to legislate. Privacy is very dependent of the context. 


## Appropriate Information Flows.
*actors*
**Sender** : who sends or shares the information
**Receiver** : who receives or collect the shared information
**Subject** : who the information is **about**

**Information type** : what type of information is shared

**Transmission principle** : what constraints the information flow (what make the privacy possible, privacy rule "as long as they keep them confidential

> [!important]
> Even if we accept an information flow that we think is inappropriate we can still feel a privacy violation using it afterward.

Culture, **social norms** and context will change how an information flow is appropriate.

## Values in information type

> [!Attention]
> Transmission principle are designed within values. It can be fore exemple security between user, or more privacy.


## Establishing Interoperability

In Europe, apps that have more than ~45 million users are called gate keeper.

However, interoperability in Europe is as now set to be established using the transmission principle of the gate keeper (messenger, whatsapp). 

It is then a clash of **value**.

Signal stated that they don't want to interoperate with Meta because they don't send the same values.

Now small project should align with Meta transmission principle.

Meta will set the rules.


## Solution

Switch from 100% "seamless" (where people don't see what transmission principle are used), but strategically "seamful".
